# Mandacaru 🌵

A lightweight Bitcoin validator node for Android, powered by [Utreexo](https://dci.mit.edu/utreexo) and [Floresta](https://github.com/vinteumorg/Floresta).

Run a validating Bitcoin node directly on your phone with minimal storage requirements thanks to Utreexo's compact accumulator design. Mandacaru uses `assumeutreexo` by default — see [the note below](#a-note-on-validation-assumeutreexo-is-enabled-by-default) for what that means for the trust model.

## Features

- ⚡ **Lightweight**: Uses Utreexo to dramatically reduce storage requirements
- 🔒 **Self-sovereign**: Validate Bitcoin transactions directly on your device
- 🌐 **Multi-network**: Support for Bitcoin Mainnet, Testnet, Testnet4, Signet, and Regtest
- 🔍 **Transaction & Broadcast**: Search transactions and broadcast raw transactions
- 🧱 **Blockchain Explorer**: Search blocks by height or hash, view headers and chain status
- 👥 **P2P Networking**: Connect, disconnect, and ping Bitcoin peers
- 💼 **Wallet Integration**: Load descriptors and track your Bitcoin addresses
- 🔌 **Electrum Server**: Built-in Electrum server for wallet pairing
- 📊 **Real-time Sync**: Monitor blockchain synchronization progress
- 🩺 **Diagnostics**: Monitor node uptime and memory usage
- 🎨 **Modern UI**: Beautiful Material Design 3 interface with dark/light themes

## What is Utreexo?

Utreexo is a dynamic hash-based accumulator that allows Bitcoin nodes to validate the blockchain without storing the full UTXO set. This reduces storage requirements from tens of gigabytes to just a few megabytes, making it practical to run a validating node on mobile devices.

## A note on validation: `assumeutreexo` is enabled by default

Mandacaru ships with `assumeutreexo` turned on. At startup the node trusts a hardcoded Utreexo state snapshot (the accumulator roots at a specific block height) and begins full validation from that point forward — verifying every new block, transaction, signature, and consensus rule from the snapshot height onward.

What this means in practice:
- **Fast startup**: the node skips re-validating ancient history and is usable in minutes instead of days.
- **Full validation going forward**: from the snapshot height on, Mandacaru is a fully validating Bitcoin node — no trusted third party for new blocks.
- **A trust assumption about pre-snapshot history**: you are trusting that the bundled snapshot matches Bitcoin's true historical chain state. This is the same trade-off as Bitcoin Core's `assumeutxo` and `assumevalid`.

### Even with `assumeutreexo`, a bad accumulator is detectable

Under Utreexo, every transaction input in every new block must come with an inclusion proof against the current accumulator state. If the bundled snapshot were wrong — wrong roots, wrong height, doctored to hide or invent UTXOs — those proofs simply would not verify as honest peers relay real blocks: signatures would check out but inclusion proofs would fail, and Mandacaru would reject the chain rather than follow it.

In other words, a bad snapshot doesn't silently corrupt the node's view of Bitcoin; it makes the node unable to follow the real chain at all. The worst plausible failure mode is a stuck or refusing node, not a node that quietly accepts invalid history. This is what makes the `assumeutreexo` trade-off reasonable in practice: you accept faster startup in exchange for a trust assumption that is self-checking against the live network.

If you want zero trust assumptions, a from-genesis IBD (initial block download) without `assumeutreexo` is not currently exposed in the UI.

## Installation

### Requirements
- Android 10 (API 29) or higher
- ARM64 device (arm64-v8a architecture)
- Internet connection

### Releases
Download the latest APK from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/jvsena42/mandacaru/releases).

> ⚠️ The APK is **ARM64-only** (`arm64-v8a`). It will not install on x86/x86_64 emulators or devices.

### Obtainium (recommended for auto-updates)
